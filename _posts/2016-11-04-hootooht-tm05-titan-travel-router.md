<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While attending the <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/security/network-data-security-ny">O'Reilly Security Conference in New York Dashboard</a>, I had the opportunity to test out my latest purchase the HooToo Titan Travel Router. I first read about this router on Jeff Atwood's Blog post - <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/your-own-personal-wifi-storage/">Your Own Personal WiFi Router</a>.<br>

While Jeff's primary use of the router was to allow his children to stream media from the built in file sharing capability on the router, I wanted it for sharing a WiFi connection while I was staying at the NY Hilton.</p>
<p>At past conferences, I was always surprised that 1) Wifi was not free to hotel guests and 2) how bloody expensive WiFi is in US hotels. In Canada, WiFi is free in 90% of hotels. I've been forced in the past to pay for multiple connections for my phone, tablet and laptop.</p>
<p>In preparation for my stay in NYC, I decided it was time to test a travel router. When the router arrived, I updated the firmware, setup the SSID, password etc. This took me approximately 20 minutes and the router was ready to go.</p>
<p>Once I arrived in my hotel room, I was shocked to learn that conference attendees were given free WiFi. This did not stop me from using the HooToo anyway. :)</p>
<p>After turning on the HooToo, I connected to the router by visiting <a href="http://10.10.10.254">http://10.10.10.254</a>. I selected the hotel WiFi from the list of available wireless networks and waited for the router to reboot.</p>
<p>After the reboot, I started Chrome on my laptop and was presented with the hotels &quot;Login to WiFi Page&quot;. After I entered the password, I was online.</p>
<p>I then joined my WiFi with my phone and tried to connect to the internet. It connected without any issues. No logging in, not accepting the hotel terms of use etc.</p>
<p>The router worked great. It ran on battery power for two days before it needed charging. The speed was great, the signal never went down.</p>
<p>The admin portal design is awful. It looks like something from the late 90s. But it does work. The other missing option is a VPN client. Doing anything over an open WiFi at a hotel/airport/coffee shop makes me queasy. Knowing how easy it is for someone to be listening to the traffic over an open WiFi connection, using a VPN just makes sense. I've seen some posts about installing OpenWRT on the HooToo. That might be my next weekend project.</p>
