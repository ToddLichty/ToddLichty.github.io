<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>With my commute shorter now that we have moved offices, I find I've had to take a critical look at the podcasts that I listen to. I had to drop some very good podcasts, but I tried to be ruthless.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a> - I love this podcast and still listen to it first. However, lately I feel that there has been a lot less relevant technical content for me. There seems to be more of a focus on minority/female guests rather than a focus on the latest and greatest technical content.</li>
<li><a href="https://twit.tv/shows/security-now">Security Now</a> - A great <a href="http://www.twit.tv">twit</a> podcast that I look forward to every week. While I do have some issues with how little Leo contributes, Steve is a great host.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com">dotNetRocks</a> - The first podcast I ever listened to. Richard and Karl are great. They release three episodes a week which can be hard to keep up with. I do tend to skip some of the episodes that I feel I won't get anything out of</li>
<li><a href="https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly">Windows Weekly</a> - Another great twit podcast, I love Paul's bluntness paired with Mary Jo's pleasant and honest demeanor.</li>
<li><a href="http://risky.biz/">Risky Business</a> - As I venture more and more into the security realm, this is a great weekly podcast that reviews the latest security issues</li>
<li><a href="https://threatpost.com/">Threatpost</a> - Another great security news roundup podcase</li>
</ul>
<p>I still use Dogg Catcher on my Nexus 5X for listening to and managing my podcasts. This app has been great!</p>
