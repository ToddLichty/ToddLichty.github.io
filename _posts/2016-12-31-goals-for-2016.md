<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Weightroom</strong></p>
<p>The gym has become a larger and larger focus of mine. I'm loving the powerlifting work that I have focused on over the past 12 months. I did not make as many gains in 2016 as I had hoped mostly due to my lower back injury. I've incorporated mobility work and stretching into my daily routine that has (so far) kept me healthy and on track.</p>
<p>Current stats/lifts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Body weight: 220 lbs</li>
<li>Squat: 185 lbs</li>
<li>Deadlift: 285 lbs</li>
<li>Bench: 255 lbs</li>
</ul>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Body weight: I'd love to get this to 205 but this isn't necessarily a focus of mine.</li>
<li>Squat: 250 lbs</li>
<li>Deadlift: 350 lbs</li>
<li>Bench: 300 lbs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Professional Life</strong></p>
<p>2016 was a great year at <a href="http://www.sherpamarketing.ca">Sherpa Marketing</a>. We had some low points but the majority of the year was nothing but positives. Some of my goals for this year will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run one-on-ones monthly</li>
<li>Finish migration of our customer's websites to Azure</li>
<li>Finish migration to GitHub from Vault</li>
<li>Finally shut down old stage server</li>
<li>Institute weekly code reviews</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personal Life</strong></p>
<p>Read more - Lately I have been watching quite a few lifting videos on YouTube to help with my lifting technique. This has caused my reading to suffer. I would like to spend more time in 2016 reading rather than watching videos. My goal will be to read 20 books in 2017.</p>
<p>I obviously need to find more goals for my personal life here. :)</p>
