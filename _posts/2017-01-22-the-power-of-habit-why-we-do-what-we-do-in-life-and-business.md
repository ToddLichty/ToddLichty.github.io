<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I just finished reading <em>The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We do in Life and Business</em> by Charles Duhigg. It was an absolutely fantastic read. The book delves deep into what makes a habit a habit, how habits are formed and most importantly, what we can do to change the habits that are not helping us achieve our goals.</p>
<p>The &quot;Habit Loop&quot; has three basic components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cue</strong> - This is the trigger that tells your brain to go into &quot;auto pilot&quot; and which habit to use.</li>
<li><strong>Routine</strong> - These are the set of activities that you perform automatically after you encounter the cue.</li>
<li><strong>Reward</strong> - The reward is what tells our brain whether to &quot;save&quot; the routine as a habit or not. If the reward is great enough, then the brain will remember the routine and &quot;run it&quot; the next time it encounters the cue.</li>
</ol>
<p>The more times we encounter this loop, the more automatic the routine becomes.</p>
<p>The examples and stories used throughout the book were fantastic. From mice running through mazes to the success of toothpaste, Duhigg presented many examples of the habit loop.</p>
