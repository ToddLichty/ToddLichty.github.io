<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A few weeks ago, the WiFi adapter on my Surface Pro 3 suddenly stopped working. I did the usual diagnostics (rebooting, reinstalling drivers, enabling and disabling network adapter) with no luck. In an act of desperation, I completely formatted the device assuming this would fix the issue. Still no luck.</p>

<p>I called Microsoft support and spent an hour basically repeating everything I had already completed. At the end of the call, I was told that I would need to send the device in for repair. Since it was out of warranty (of course), I would be responsible for the repair bill.</p>
<p>I've been thinking of replacing the device and took this as a sign from the universe that it was time. :)</p>
<p>I spent some time researching what I wanted and decided on the new <a href="http://www.dell.com/ca/p/xps-13-9365-2-in-1-laptop/pd">Dell XPS 13 9365 2-in-1</a>. I don't use my laptop for gaming (when I actually have time to game, I use the Xbox) and don't need anything super beefy. I have access to lots of higher end hardware at work or I can always spin up something in the cloud.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep the tablet form factor but wanted a &quot;real&quot; keyboard. This lead me to purchase the XPS 13 2-in-1.</p>
<p>I've been using the device for 2 days now and so far am very happy with it. I hope to do a detailed write up in the future but my initial thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Love the keyboard. Just enough play in the keys.</li>
<li>The screen is amazing. I have the touchscreen QHD display and it is simply gorgeous</li>
<li>It is hard to pry the screen open. It can't be done with one hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most annoying aspect of the device is the &quot;adaptive brightness&quot;. This is an &quot;add-on&quot; from Dell that causes the brightness to adjust based on the room the device is used in. It was brutal. There are a number of reviews on the <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/20003189">web</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1370387">bemoaning</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/5roev2/is_it_possible_to_turn_off_adaptive_brightness_on/">this</a> functionality.</p>
<p>I came across a Reddit post that linked to an update on the Dell site to fix this problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/ca/en/cabsdt1/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=8GDDH&amp;fileId=3598929443&amp;osCode=WT64A&amp;productCode=xps-13-9365-2-in-1-laptop&amp;languageCode=en&amp;categoryId=AP">http://www.dell.com/support/home/ca/en/cabsdt1/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=8GDDH&amp;fileId=3598929443&amp;osCode=WT64A&amp;productCode=xps-13-9365-2-in-1-laptop&amp;languageCode=en&amp;categoryId=AP</a></p>
<p>Now that the screen stays the brightness I set it to, I can continue to review the unit. Had this fix not existed, it would have been enough for me to send the unit back to Dell.</p>
