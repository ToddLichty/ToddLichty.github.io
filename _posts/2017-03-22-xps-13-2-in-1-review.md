<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I’ve recently returned from a two-day business trip to Winnipeg. This was my first real opportunity to make use of my new Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 away from home. Overall, I was extremely happy with how the laptop performed.</p>
<p><strong>Light</strong><br>
When travelling, light really does matter. Even if the laptop does spend 99% of its time on a table, you really appreciate how light the device is when you are travelling.</p>
<p><strong>Battery</strong><br>
I spent the 2.5-hour flight watching Vikings as well as working on a Word document for work. The battery started at 100% and was still at 85% when we landed. The sound quality while using my 5-year-old noise cancelling Sony headphones was great. The screen was perfect in terms of brightness.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong><br>
I only use my laptop for Office, web browsing and minor code fixes with Visual Code. For anything more advanced or performance intensive I used VPN and RDP to access my workstation at the office.</p>
<p><strong>WiFi</strong><br>
So far the wireless on this laptop has been perfect. It has not had any issues connecting to any of the WiFi networks that I have come across.</p>
<p><strong>Dell Active Pen</strong><br>
I purchased the Dell pen but never made use of it. I really have a hard time writing notes. I’m much quicker typing than writing by hand. It was the same when I had my Surface Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Tablet Mode</strong><br>
I made considerably more use of the tablet mode on this trip than I have in the previous month I owned the device. I have to admit that this device is heavier to use as a tablet than the Surface Pro was. Browsing the internet in the hotel room while lying on my bed was more awkward with this laptop than the Surface Pro ever was.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Lapability&quot;</strong><br>
When I was a Surface fanatic, I felt that the “lapability” argument was overhyped. I felt that the Surface was just as usable on my lap as a regular laptop was. I’ve never been so wrong. Even with the Surface keyboard, there was never an easy way to use the laptop on my lap. I did not realize how much I missed this ability.</p>
<p>This laptop has been one of the best gadget purchases I have made in the past few years.</p>
