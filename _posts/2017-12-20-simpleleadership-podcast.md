<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I recently started listening to the <a href="http://simpleleadership.io/">SimpleLeadership Podcast</a>. The first episode I listened to was <a href="http://simpleleadership.io/engineering-leadership-principals-with-oren-ellenbogen/">Engineering Leadership Principals with Oren Ellenbogen</a>. I have subscribed to Oren's <a href="https://softwareleadweekly.com/">Software Lead Weekly</a> newsletter for years and have found some great articles that have helped with my leadership development.</p>
<p>During the podcast, Oren mentioned a video by Dick Costolo that he felt every leader should watch.</p>

<p>The gist of the video was:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a leader, you must care deeply about your team WITHOUT worrying about what they think of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find YOUR individual superpower and leverage that to be successful in your own way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A great video and two great takeaways.</p>
