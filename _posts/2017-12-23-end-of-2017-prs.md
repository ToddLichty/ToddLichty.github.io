<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I took this week to test my PRs. I was able to improve 3 out of the 4. My bench seems to have stagnated at 280.</p>
<p>Squat - 345lbs<br>
Bench - 280 lbs<br>
Deadlift - 385 lbs<br>
Overhead press - 165 lbs</p>
<p>Overall, I am fairly happy with my progression this year. As a 39 year old lifter, I've been making very small increments when lifting and have been able to stay healthy and injury free in 2017.</p>
<p>I spent that last 3 months running the <a href="https://kizentraining.com/p/infinite-off-season">KIZEN Infinite Off-Season for Powerlifting</a> program. I have to admit, I really enjoyed the program. I would LOVE to run the <a href="http://www.calgarybarbell.com/free-16week-program">Calgary Barbell 16-week program</a> next, however, January and February are ALWAYS brutal in the gym. Trying to get a squat rack every day will be tough. I'm thinking of just running 531 for the first few weeks and then transitioning over to the 16-week program once the resolutionists have left.</p>
