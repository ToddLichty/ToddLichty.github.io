<p>As I mentioned in my last few posts, I am currently working on a project using Python and Django. This is a big change from the .NET projects I have worked on in the past. I found an excellent YouTube channel that has a great Django tutorial. I have linked to the playlist below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Coery does a great job of walking the viewer through the installation, setup and configuration of the Django framework as well as through a simple web application. The videos can be completed in a couple of days.</p>
