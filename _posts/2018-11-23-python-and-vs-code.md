<p>I came across and interesting github repo in the <a href="https://pycoders.com/">PyCoder's weekly</a> newsletter. It was titled <a href="https://github.com/qubitron/pydemo">Get Productive With Python and VS Code</a>. </p><p>The repo contains a number of python code files along with links to various videos and slides. I watched the Dan Taylor video from EuroPython - July 2018 and the examples were very slick.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6YLMWU-5H9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Dan demos using VS Code to setup a virtual environment, debug a flask project, integrate with Docker and many shortcuts for VS Code. The videos and project are a great starting point for working more efficiently with Python and VS Code.</p>
