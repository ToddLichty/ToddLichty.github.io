<p>Below are the notes I took while reading Chris Hogan's book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Everyday-Millionaires-Ordinary-Extraordinary-Wealth_and/dp/0977489523/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548422979&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=everyday+millionaires+chris+hogan">Everyday Millionaires: How Ordinary People Built Extraordinary Wealth―and How You Can Too</a>. To be honest, I was not thrilled with the book. It felt like a summary of Dave Ramsey's The Total Money Makeover. I wish the book had delved into more of the interviews that were conducted rather than just presenting endless stats.</p><p>The notes I took while reading this book:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h4>Common myths regarding the rich:</h4>
