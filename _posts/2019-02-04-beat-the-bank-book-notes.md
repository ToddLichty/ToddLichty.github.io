<p>I was lucky enough to be given a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Beat-Bank-Canadian-Successful-Investing/dp/1775343707/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546266503&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=beat+the+bank">Beat The Bank by Larry Bates</a> as a Christmas present from my wife. I added the book to my wish list after listening to an interview with Larry on the <a href="https://canadiancouchpotato.com/2018/09/28/podcast-19-the-big-tradeoff/">Canadian Couch Potato podcast</a>.</p><p>The book was a very fast and easy read. The first few chapters were geared more towards the novice investor, there was a lot to learn from the book. My main takeaways were:</p><ol><li>Wealth builders include: amount, time, rate</li><li>Wealth killers are: fees, tax, inflation</li><li>"Old Bay Street" kills investments with their ridiculously high MER fees.</li><li>Beat the Bank three rules of fees: Â find fees, reduce fees, repeat</li><li>Use the <a href="http://larrybates.ca/t-rex-score/">T-REX calculator</a> to determine the REAL cost of owning a mutual fund.</li><li>T-REX scores need to be as close to 100% as possible. Mutual funds are not the way to achieve this.</li><li>ETFs have T-REX scores in the high 90s which will help keep more savings in your account.</li><li>Always use tax sheltered accounts whenever possible (TFSA, RRSP, RESP)</li><li>Interest rates must be higher than inflation or your money is worth less than it was when it was first added to the savings account.</li><li>A "free" plan from an "Old Bay Street" advisor is NOT free. They make their money selling high MER mutual funds.</li></ol>
