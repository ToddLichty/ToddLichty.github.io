    <li><b>Calorie Restriction / Fasting</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Has the potential to increase longevity and improve health</li>
        <li>Very difficult for most people to implement</li>
        <li>Can try to stop eating before you feel full (like the Okinawans) but most are unable to do this</li>
        <li>More practical may be to try intermittent fasting
        	<ul>
                <li>12 - 14 hours of fasting. Only eat between the hours of 8AM and 6PM.</li>
                <li>16:8 - Fast for 16 hours and eat for 8. Eat all meals between 11AM and 7PM</li>
                <li>Alternate day fasting - Fast for 24 hours, eat for 24 hours</li>
                <li>Prolonged fasting - Fast for more than 24 hours at a time</li></ul>
        </li>
            </ul></li>
    <li><b>mTOR/Protein</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Many different determinants of optimal protein intake.</li>
        <li>Whey supplementation has several health benefits</li>
        <li>Resistance training - Aim for 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day</li>
        <li>Nonresistance training: Aim for 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day</li>
        <li>50% of your protein intake should come from animal sources and 50% from plant sources.</li>
        <li>Try to use organic protein when possible.</li>
        <li>Aim for 50% of your animal protein to come from marine sources (oysters, fish etc.)</li>
        <li>Use a variety of plant protein sources (spinach, onions, garlic, beans)</li>
        <li>Collagen (20 - 60 grams) and Glycine (10 to 15 grams) supplements are useful</li>
        
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>Coffee, Tea and Wine</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Drinking 1 - 5 cups of coffee per day seems best.</li>
            <li>Coffee provides many antioxidants</li>
            <li>Need to avoid adding sugar / sweeteners</li>
            <li>Caffeinated coffee does offer more benefits with regards to waist size and visceral fat loss</li>
            <li>Green tea is a longevity secret of much of the Asian subcontinent</li>
            <li>Black and oolong tea contain many other flavonoids that are similarly beneficial</li>
            <li>1-6 cups of tea daily offers the most benefit</li>
            <li>Red wine is consistently associated with longevity</li>
            <li>Wine should be low in sugar</li>
            <li>Consume wine with your largest meal of the day</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Sodium and Magnesium</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Your body requires 4 grams of sodium per day</li>
            <li>Should choose magnesium glycinate or magnesium citrate over the cheaper and more popular oxide</li>
            <li>Everyone should be supplementing with 300 milligrams of magnesium per day</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Eat more natural, healthy fats</b>
    	<ul>
            <li>Consume 2 to 4 grams of EPA and DHA per day from wild seafood</li>
            <li>Take high quality krill oil supplement and a high quality fish oil supplement</li>
            <li>Consume omega-3s from chia, hemp or flax seeds (30 - 60 grams)</li>
            <li>Eat and cook animal fat!</li>
            <li>Omega-6 fats should come from whole foods (nuts, seeds, eggs, chicken). Keep omega-6 to omega-3 ratio at 4 or less</li>
            <li>Consume 1 tablespoon of organic extra-virgin olive oil per day</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
