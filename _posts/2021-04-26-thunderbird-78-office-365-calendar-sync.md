There is a great post [here](https://www.systutorials.com/how-to-synchronize-thunderbird-calendar-and-address-book-with-office365-exchange-online-using-activesync/) on configuring Thunderbird 78 to read your Office 365 calendar.

I followed the steps verbatim and they worked flawlessly with Thunderbird 78.7.1 on Ubuntu 20.04
